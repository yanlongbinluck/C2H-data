# C2H-data
We have released our C2H-data and Synthetic-data proposed in paper 'Reconstruction of Hyperspectral Data from RGB Images with Prior Category Information'. The 30-channel hyperspectral image data (HSI) is saved as .tiff file, we have provided its corresponding RGB data and given carefully labeled object bounding boxes.
